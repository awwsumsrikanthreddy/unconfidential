1. top - Process Activity Command

Commonly Used Hot Keys

The top command provides several useful hot keys:
Hot Key	Usage
t	Displays summary information off and on.
m	Displays memory information off and on.
A	Sorts the display by top consumers of various system resources. Useful for quick identification of performance-hungry tasks on a system.

2: vmstat - System Activity, Hardware and System Information

The command vmstat reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and cpu activity.
command:# vmstat 3


Display Memory Utilization Slabinfo

command:# vmstat -m


Get Information About Active / Inactive Memory Pages

command: # vmstat -a



3: w - Find Out Who Is Logged on And What They Are Doing

w command displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes.

commanad:# w username

4: uptime - Tell How Long The System Has Been Running

>>The uptime command can be used to see how long the server has been running. The current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

command: # uptime

Output:

 18:02:41 up 41 days, 23:42,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

>>1 can be considered as optimal load value. The load can change from system to system. For a single CPU system 1 - 3 and SMP systems 6-10 load value might be acceptable.

ps command will report a snapshot of the current processes. To select all processes use the -A or -e option:

command: # ps -A

Show Long Format Output

command: # ps -Al
