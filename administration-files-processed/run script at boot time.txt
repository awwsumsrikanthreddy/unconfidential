run a script at boot time



The scripts that run on start up are stored in the /etc/init.d/ directory. 


 Adding a script to run at startup

1.To make a script run at startup of your Xen virtual machine you need to put the script in /etc/init.d and make sure it will take the start and stop arguements. 

2.Once the script is in /etc/init.d you need to tell the system when to run the script. You can use the following command:

chkconfig --level 345 scriptname on

The above command tells the system what runlevel the script needs to be run at. For most scipts the you will want the runlevels of 3, 4, and 5.
