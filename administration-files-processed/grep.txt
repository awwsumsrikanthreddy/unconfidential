1.search multiple strings

grep 'word1\|word2\|word3' /path/to/file

example: $ grep 'warning\|error\|critical' /var/log/messages



grep -E ‘error|critical’ sample.txt2.


I also wanted to find all files that contained two separate words. The words could be anywhere in the file.

One way that I found to do this is:
grep -l word1 `grep -l word2 *`


The backtick quotes execute what is inside the quotes and replace it with the results. -l returns file names only.

More commonly I would also include -ir for case-ignorant recursive search:
grep -irl word1 `grep -irl word2 *`
