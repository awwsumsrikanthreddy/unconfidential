    This package contains the mongod daemon and associated configuration and init scripts.

  3.  mongodb-org-mongos

    This package contains the mongos daemon.

  4.  mongodb-org-shell

  5.  mongodb-org-tools

    This package contains the following MongoDB tools: mongoimport bsondump, mongodump, mongoexport, mongofiles, mongooplog, mongoperf, mongorestore, mongostat, and mongotop.





Install MongoDB
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 1.Configure the package management system (yum).

 2.Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.0.repo file so that you can install MongoDB directly, using yum.

 3.Changed in version 3.0: MongoDB Linux packages for 3.0 are in a new repository.
   

For the latest stable release of MongoDB

Use the following repository file:


command: vim /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.0.repo


[mongodb-org-3.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/3.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
installing earlier versions to 3.0
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1.command: vim /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-2.6.repo


[mongodb-org-2.6]
name=MongoDB 2.6 Repository
baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1


2.Install the MongoDB packages and associated tools.

When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.


>>To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following command:


command: sudo yum install -y mongodb-org


>>To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each component package individually and append the version number to the package name, as in the following example:


command:sudo yum install -y mongodb-org-3.0.6 mongodb-org-server-3.0.6 mongodb-org-shell-3.0.6 mongodb-org-mongos-3.0.6 mongodb-org-tools-3.0.6

exclude mongodb for update
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

command: vim /etc/yum.conf

exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools


Run MongoDB
>>>>>>>>>>>


>>Disable SELinux entirely by changing the SELINUX setting to disabled in /etc/selinux/config.

          SELINUX=disabled

>>Set SELinux to permissive mode in /etc/selinux/config by changing the SELINUX setting to permissive .

          SELINUX=permissive


or


Enable access to the relevant ports (e.g. 27017) for SELinux if in enforcing mode. See Default MongoDB Port for more information on MongoDB’s default ports. For default settings, this can be accomplished by running

command: semanage port -a -t mongod_port_t -p tcp 27017



Data Directories and Permissions
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

/var/lib/mongo  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   mongodb data files

/var/log/mongodb >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  mongodb log file

/etc/mongod.conf >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> config file
 
mongod >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> user 


>>If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you must modify the access control rights to the /var/lib/mongo and /var/log/mongodb directories to give this user access to these directories.



Start MongoDB
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

command: sudo service mongod start

Verify that MongoDB has started successfully


command: tail -f /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log


command: sudo chkconfig mongod on

command:sudo service mongod restart



Uninstall MongoDB
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

stopping mongodb and removing packages
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

command: sudo service mongod stop

command: sudo yum erase $(rpm -qa | grep mongodb-org)



remove log and data files of mongodb
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

command: sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb

command: sudo rm -r /var/lib/mongo




>>The difference between a replication set and master-slave replication is that a replication set has an intrinsic automatic failover mechanism in case the primary member becomes unavailable.



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

sharding:
>>>>>>>>>>>

Shards: Shards are used to store data. They provide high availability and data consistency. In production environment each shard is a separate replica set.


Config Servers: Config servers store the cluster's metadata. This data contains a mapping of the cluster's data set to the shards. The query router uses this metadata to target operations to specific shards. In production environment sharded clusters have exactly 3 config servers


Query Routers: Query Routers are basically mongos instances, interface with client applications and direct operations to the appropriate shard. The query router processes and targets operations to shards and then returns results to the clients. A sharded cluster can contain more than one query router to divide the client request load. A client sends requests to one query router. Generally a sharded cluster have many query routers.

after installing mongodb
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


command: #service mongod status  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  mongodb service status
 
command: #mongostat          >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Summary List of Status Statistic

command: #mongo              >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Enter the MongoDB Command Line



>>By default, running this command will look for a MongoDB server listening on port 27017 on the localhost interface.

>>If you’d like to connect to a MongoDB server running on a different port, then use the –port option. 

>>For example, if you wanted to connect to a local MongoDB server listening on port 22222, then you’d issue the following command:


command: #mongo --port 22222


Shutdown MongoDB:

command: #service mongod stop
