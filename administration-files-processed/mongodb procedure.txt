Procedure
>>>>>>>>>>>>



1
Connect to MongoDB with the appropriate privileges.

Connect to mongod or mongos either through the localhost exception or as a user with the privileges indicated in the prerequisites section.

In the following example, manager has the required privileges specified in Prerequisites.

mongo --port 27017 -u manager -p 123456 --authenticationDatabase admin

2
Create the system user administrator.

Add the user with the userAdminAnyDatabase role, and only that role.

The following example creates the user siteUserAdmin user on the admin database:

use admin
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "siteUserAdmin",
    pwd: "password",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)

3
Create a user administrator for a single database.

Optionally, you may want to create user administrators that only have access to administer users in a specific database by way of the userAdmin role.

The following example creates the user recordsUserAdmin on the records database:

use records
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "recordsUserAdmin",
    pwd: "password",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdmin", db: "records" } ]
  }
)
